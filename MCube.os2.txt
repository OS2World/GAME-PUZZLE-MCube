This is the OS/2 port of MCube, a rubik cube solver for the command line.

I did it by slightly modifying the original makefile (here included with the
complete source distribution) and it seems to work fine.

The complete documentation is in the file readme.txt, so please take a look
at it before trying.

Please consider making Paul Smedley a donation for his work in GCC!

Have fun solving Rubik cubes :)
